# MyToySocialNetwork

This is a "toy social network" ,that I implemented (using: Java, JavaFX, Gradle, PostgreSQL) as an university project during the first semester of the second academic year.
It has the following features: 
  - Login/Logout
  - Register
  - Add/Search/Remove friends
  - Send/Cancel friend requests
  - Send messages
  - New logins
